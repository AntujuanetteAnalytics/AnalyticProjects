This repository will hold all of my SQL, Excel &amp; Python projects. This is a temporary vessel to house all of my completed, current and future projects.

# [Pizza Sales](https://github.com/AntujuanetteAnalytics/AnalyticProjects/blob/main/Pizza_Sales_Sql_Data_Final%20Project.xlsx)
Prior to doing deep analysis, I imported the CSV file into SQL creating a sound cross refrence for KPIs that I would later utilize in Excel.

The insights extracted from this data set give valuable information on general business KPIs that stakeholders can utilize to track general growth of the company over the last year. Filtering the visuals by quarter, month(s), week(s) or day(s) provides indepth understanding of the trends that are direct contributions to the buisness's success. Trends that I found intriguing were:

--Orders peaked on Thursdays/Friday around 12PM-1PM with a following influx at 5PM-6PM.
--Classic paves way slightly ahead of the opposing Categories, making up roughly 26% of sales while Large dominates as most demanding, contributing to a rounded 46% of sales per Size.
--Classic Deluxe pizza sets the bar with 2432 sells while the contrasting Brie Carre is hardly relavent with 490 sells

With all the data having been analyzed, a few actionable suggetions I would make is to open the Pizza Shop later as the data shows only 9 pizzas. I would also think about selling the Brie Carre seasonaly or perhapes removing it all together as the cost of goods would decrease if we didn't have to budget for it.

# [Data Wrangling- Mental Heath in Tech Survey](https://github.com/AntujuanetteAnalytics/AnalyticProjects/blob/main/Mental%20Health%20Tech%20Survey_Data%20Wrangling-SQL.pdf)
I did a deep data wrangling in SQL. I utilized multiple functions (UPDATE, CREATE TABLE, #TEMPTABLES, ETC.) 

--WHERE IS NOT NULL-There where quite a few NULL values in the dataset. After contemplating the impact of excluding these samples, filtering the out the missing data appeared to be the most sound option. To accomplish this I used WHERE IS NOT NULL excluding comments as this is optional and state due to the audience being worldwide. 
--UPDATE-Much of the gender column was free form and had multiple answers. For accuracy in analysis, I used the UPDATE statement to group same values. Deductive reasoning was used to sort misspelled or incomplete data. There where other columns that UPDATE was utilized to clean up an normalize the values.
--SELECT INTO/CREATE TABLE- After filtering the NULLS, I was left with a brand new table. To materalize those results I would have to execute the filtering statement in every new session. For better efficenty, I originally used SELECT INTO to create a #TEMPTABLE. However, this was essentially the same thing with having to generate it sessionally so I, agai, used SELECT INTO and created a permenate table in the database.
--EXEC SP_RENAME: The column names were vauge and lacking uniformity. To make the column names realational to the columns values, I used the stored procedure; EXEC SP_RENAME, to clean it all up.
