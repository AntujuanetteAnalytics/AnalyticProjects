# AnalyticProjects
This repository will hold all of my SQL, Excel &amp; Python projects. This is a temporary vessel to house all of my completed, current and future projects.

# Pizza Sales(https://github.com/AntujuanetteAnalytics/AnalyticProjects/blob/main/PizzaSales%20Insight.xlsx)
 I was able to accomplish this project with the help of this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmpsNMcumts&t=6961s). I wanted to find a project to do as almost a walkthrough so I could get a foundational understanding on all of the technical applications and the different use cases for the multiple tools used in data analyzing.

Excel and SQL were the tools used to clean, query and analyze this data set.
