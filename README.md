# AnalyticProjects
This repository will hold all of my SQL, Excel &amp; Python projects. This is a temporary vessel to house all of my completed, current and future projects.

# [Pizza Sales](https://github.com/AntujuanetteAnalytics/AnalyticProjects/blob/main/Pizza_Sales_Sql_Data_Final%20Project.xlsx)
 I was able to accomplish this project with the guide of (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmpsNMcumts&t=6961s). I did a guided project so I could get a foundational understanding on all of the technical applications and the different use cases for the multiple tools used in data analyzing.

Excel and SQL were the tools used to clean, query and analyze this data set.

# [Data Wrangling- Mental Heath in Tech Survey](https://github.com/AntujuanetteAnalytics/AnalyticProjects/blob/main/Mental%20Health%20Tech%20Survey_Data%20Wrangling-SQL.pdf)
I did a deep data wrangling in SQL. I utilized multiple funcitons (UPDATE, CREATE TABLE, #TEMPTABLES, ETC.) TO NORMALIZE COLUMNS, FILTER NULLS, ETC. There is an index column that I initially wanted to re-sequence, I found that if I did, I would lose some of the integrity. If I ever wanted to cross reference a row against the original data set, the index would be important. Also, I ran a duplicate check and 0 returned.
